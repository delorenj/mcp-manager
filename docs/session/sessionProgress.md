# Session Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Set up basic project structure using Oclif CLI framework
   - Initialized new TypeScript project
   - Configured ESM modules
   - Added necessary dependencies

2. ✅ Implemented `list` command
   - Created command in `src/commands/list.ts`
   - Command reads MCP settings from VSCode configuration
   - Outputs server list in JSON format
   - Includes server name, command, args, disabled status, and environment variable count

3. ✅ Added tests for the `list` command
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Mock filesystem for testing
   - Test cases for successful listing and error handling

4. ✅ Added documentation
   - Created README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Command shows up in help text via @oclif/plugin-help

## Next Steps

1. Test the CLI in a real environment with actual MCP servers
2. Consider adding more features like:
   - Filtering servers by status
   - Pretty-print output option
   - Detailed view of specific servers

## Notes

- Successfully implemented all core requirements from sessionGoal.md
- Tests are passing and code follows best practices
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
