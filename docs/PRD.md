# MCP Manager
## Product Requirements Document
Version 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
MCP Manager is a protocol and toolset for sharing Model Context Protocol (MCP) settings between different MCP clients. It consists of a CLI tool with a Visual Studio Code extension interface, designed to simplify the management and sharing of MCP configurations across various clients such as VSCode extensions and Claude Desktop.

## Problem Statement
Currently, MCP configurations are siloed within individual clients, making it difficult to:
- Share configurations across team members
- Maintain consistent settings across different projects
- Handle sensitive information securely
- Manage settings across multiple MCP clients
- Deal with machine-specific configurations

## Product Goals
1. Provide a unified way to manage MCP configurations across different clients
2. Enable secure sharing of configurations within teams
3. Simplify the process of applying configurations across projects
4. Support machine-specific settings adaptations
5. Offer both CLI and GUI (VSCode) interfaces

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. MCP Server Management
   - Track and manage MCP server connections
   - Handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
   - Monitor server health and connection status
   - Support parallel server connections
   - Log server connection events

2. Configuration Management
   - Freeze current MCP settings to JSON format
   - Generate separate .env files for sensitive information
   - List available settings across projects/clients
   - Apply settings from existing configurations
   - Support for multiple client adapters
   - Handle machine-specific settings variations

2. Client Support
   - Implement adapter pattern for client compatibility
   - Support multiple client types (VSCode extensions, Claude Desktop, etc.)
   - Allow easy integration of new client types
   - Maintain client-specific setting formats

3. Architecture
   - CLI-first design
   - VSCode extension as secondary interface
   - Optional local discoverable server component
   - Containerized server deployment
   - Adapter pattern for client format compatibility
